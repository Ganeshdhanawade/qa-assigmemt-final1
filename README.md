## Overview
This project automates the lifecycle of a machine learning model, from training and versioning to deployment and monitoring. It ensures reproducibility, scalability, and continuous improvement of the model.

---

## Architecture
![MLOps Architecture](path/to/architecture-diagram.jpg)

The pipeline consists of three major stages:
1. **Training**: Data preparation, model training, and versioning.
2. **Deployment**: Model packaging into a container and deploying as an API service.
3. **Monitoring**: Tracking model performance and detecting data or performance drift.

---

## Features
- Data versioning with **DVC** and storage on **AWS S3**.
- Model tracking and logging with **MLflow**.
- Deployment using **Docker** and **AWS ECS**.
- Real-time monitoring using **Evidently AI**.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Versioning**: DVC, AWS S3
- **Model Tracking**: MLflow
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Deployment**: AWS ECS
- **Monitoring**: Evidently AI
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI
